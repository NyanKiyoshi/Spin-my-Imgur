Spin my Imgur
=============
After many and many users saying they would like having an add-on to change the loading gif of
[Imgur.com](https://imgur.com) on the famous [firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) web browser (which Chrome
[already](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/imgurian-tweaks/hljlokiakakknbbkpcoaceibkjmffnkp/related) has one).
So there you go! [May your wish be reality](#Link-Imgur-Gallery)!

How does it work?
=================
It's pretty easy, this add-on observes if a .gif into the following pattern: `https?://s.imgur.com/images/loaders/*/*.gif`
then the request is redirected to your custom URL (the add-on don't check the URL, invalid or not, it does what you want).

How to use?
===========
After having installed this add-on from here from the [AOM (Add-On Manager)](https://addons.mozilla.org/) an icon
should normally be appeared on your browser's toolbar (often at the right). This logo looks like the firefox logo but
with water green instead of the blue (green being the color of Imgur).

If you click on this button, a panel should opening and into this one you can paste (using `CTRL + V`) a new loading image.

Bellow this field, you also have a slider to choose the scale factor if never your image is too big or too small
(it stays better to having just the good size but seeing the default loading image of Imgur is pretty small, often your one will be
a bit small too).

And you're good to click on "Submit" to save your changes! Now you can open Imgur and enjoy your new loading gif!
Don't forget to refresh the Imgur page using `CTRL + MAJ + R` (useful to refresh the cache) or `CTRL + R`.
